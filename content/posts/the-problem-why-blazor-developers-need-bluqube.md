+++

When Microsoft introduced Blazor, it promised to revolutionize web development by allowing C# developers to build interactive web applications without JavaScript. The technology delivered on that promise, but it also introduced a new challenge: the choice between Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly (WASM).

## The Tale of Two Blazors

Blazor Server runs your application on the server, streaming UI updates over a SignalR connection. It's fast to load, works on any device, and has full access to server resources. But it requires a constant connection and can feel laggy over slow networks.

Blazor WebAssembly, on the other hand, downloads your entire application to the browser and runs it client-side. It works offline, feels snappy once loaded, and can be deployed to any static hosting service. But it has a large initial download size and limited access to system resources.

As a developer, you're forced to choose your deployment model early in the project, and that choice affects every line of code you write.

## The Write-Twice Reality

Here's where the problem becomes real. Let's say you're building a simple todo application. In traditional Blazor development, your code might look like this:

**Blazor Server approach:**

```csharp
// Direct database access in your component
@inject IDbContext DbContext

private async Task AddTodo(string title)
{
    var todo = new Todo { Title = title };
    DbContext.Todos.Add(todo);
    await DbContext.SaveChangesAsync();
    await LoadTodos(); // Refresh the list
}
```

**Blazor WASM approach:**

```csharp
// HTTP API calls in your component
@inject HttpClient Http

private async Task AddTodo(string title)
{
    var command = new { Title = title };
    var response = await Http.PostAsJsonAsync("/api/todos", command);
    if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
    {
        await LoadTodos(); // Refresh the list
    }
}
```

Notice the problem? These are completely different approaches. Your components, your data access patterns, your error handling - everything is different. If you want to support both deployment models, you're essentially building two applications.

## The Integration Nightmare

But wait, it gets worse. Modern applications aren't just about data access. They need:

- **Validation**: Different validation strategies for client vs server
- **Error Handling**: Server errors vs HTTP errors vs client-side exceptions
- **Authorization**: Server-side claims vs JWT tokens vs API keys
- **Logging**: Server logs vs browser console vs remote telemetry
- **State Management**: Server state vs client state synchronization

Each of these concerns multiplies your complexity when supporting both Blazor models.

## Real-World Impact

I've seen teams solve this in different ways:

1. **Pick one and stick with it** - Limiting your deployment options
2. **Build separate applications** - Double the development and maintenance cost
3. **Create abstraction layers** - Complex, custom solutions that are hard to maintain
4. **Use existing frameworks** - Heavy, opinionated solutions that don't fit Blazor's paradigms

None of these solutions felt right to me. There had to be a better way.

## What Developers Really Want

After talking to other Blazor developers, the requirements became clear:

- Write business logic once, deploy anywhere
- Simple, intuitive patterns that feel native to C#
- Built-in validation and error handling
- Minimal boilerplate code
- Easy to test and maintain
- Performance optimizations out of the box

This is exactly the problem BluQube was designed to solve.

## The Vision

Imagine writing your application logic like this:

```csharp
// Define your intent
public record AddTodoCommand(string Title) : ICommand;

// Handle it once
public class AddTodoHandler : ICommandHandler<AddTodoCommand>
{
    public async Task<CommandResult> Handle(AddTodoCommand request)
    {
        // Your business logic here - same everywhere
        var todo = new Todo { Title = request.Title };
        await _repository.AddAsync(todo);
        return CommandResult.Success();
    }
}

// Use it everywhere
await _commander.Send(new AddTodoCommand("Learn BluQube"));
```

The same code. The same patterns. Whether you're running on the server or in the browser.

## Coming Up Next

In the next article, I'll introduce BluQube and show you how it makes this vision a reality. We'll explore the core concepts that enable true "write once, run anywhere" development in Blazor, and you'll see how a simple architectural pattern can eliminate the complexity of dual-deployment scenarios.

BluQube isn't just another framework - it's a new way of thinking about Blazor development that puts your business logic first and deployment concerns second.
